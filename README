GENERAL DESCRIPTION

This program calculates the pore size distribution
from a structure file. The program does not need the
connect records, only the locations and atom types,
so the xyz format is the simplest to work with. If 
your structure is in a pdb or mol2 format, use babel 
to convert: i.e. openbabel -ipdb struc.pdb -oxyz struc.xyz
The atoms are modeled as hard spheres (vdW radii).
The program uses a nonlinear optimization routine (SOLVOPT)

INSTALL

Run the install script (./install)
Then place the executable (psd) somewhere in your path or 
create a link in /usr/local/bin. 
Place radii_list.dat in the same directory where you run 
the program. This file  contains the vdW radii of the 
common atom types used by the program. New user defined 
atom types can be added to radii_list.dat.

RUN

psd <xyz file> <test particle radius (A)> <histogram bin width (A)>
A bin width of 0.25A seems to be the optimum.  The output produces
three files: psd_diff.dat (the actual distribution), psd_cumm.dat
(cummulative PSD, see paper for explanation) and error.dat (shows 
the average error over time / MC steps).

Once you start the program, a rough profile can be seen within an hour. 
However, it may take upto 24 hours to get a smooth profile 
(depending on the system size). Please continue to monitor the 
distribution and the estimated error. Once you are satisfied with the results,
just kill the process, simple!!
